Jen's Zen Starterkit Theme for Drupal 7

I make Drupal websites sometimes. And when I do, I design and create a custom theme on top of the Zen theme. I love Zen. I think it's great. https://www.drupal.org/project/zen

What I don't love about Zen is the way the CSS is organized. I have my own preferences about CSS structure, and so I rearrange things and do it my way. I also have a lot of opinions about Drupal's HTML and CSS, and tend to use the same set of overrides over and over. So... basically I need my own master child of Zen to use each time I start a new project. 

I don't believe in this child-of-Zen theme enough to put it on drpual.org. In fact, really I could just keep it private and never share it with anyone. That's what I've been doing for years. But hey, why not get better organized, clean things up a bit, and put this on Github? Perhaps you'll find it useful. Perhaps no one will ever look at it, let alone use it. But meanwhile I can pretend someone will be looking at it, and use that pretense to nudge me to organize myself better. Or if nothing else, put something someplace useful so that the next time I'm starting a new website on top of Drupal 7, I have a place to get my starterkit. 

This code won't do anything by itself. You need Zen 7.x-5.x. And of course, you need Drupal. Be sure to read the Zen documentation. Read the <a href="https://drupal.org/node/873778">online docs</a> or the included README.txt on how to create a theme with Zen.

By the way, I also always install a copy of my own admin theme. It's a child of Seven, and fixes up a lot of the bugs and UX problems that Seven has. Check it out. https://www.drupal.org/project/sevenplus
